#### 3. Department Hierarchy
- **Current Gap**: Basic department structure without support for complex relationships
- **Impact**: Limited ability to manage cross-department subscriptions
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

#### 4. Technical Integration
- **Current Gap**: Limited support for technical owner role and integration documentation
- **Impact**: Incomplete tracking of technical requirements and responsibilities
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

### Process Gaps

#### 1. Multi-Stage Approval Workflow
- Need for staged approvals involving multiple stakeholders
- Support for delegation of approval authority
