## Using This Documentation

These concepts build upon the definitions established in our [Glossary](../glossary.md) and are illustrated through our [User Personas](../user-personas/). When reading these documents:

1. Start with the basic concept explanation
2. Review any referenced user personas for practical examples
3. Consider how these concepts apply to different organizational structures
4. Understand how these relationships influence system access and capabilities

## Relationship with User Personas

While our [User Personas](../user-personas/) provide specific examples of individuals and their roles, these concept documents focus on the underlying relationships and principles that govern how different types of users interact with Applogie's features and with each other.

For example, when discussing subscription ownership, we might reference how a persona like [Samuel Singh](../user-personas/external/subscription-owner.md) typically handles these responsibilities, but the concept documentation focuses on the principles and patterns that any subscription owner would follow.
