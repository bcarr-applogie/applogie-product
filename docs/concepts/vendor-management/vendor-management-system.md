# Vendor Management System

## Overview

The Vendor Management System is a core component of the Applogie platform that handles the discovery, validation, and maintenance of vendor data. This system ensures that accurate and up-to-date vendor information is available throughout the platform.

## Key Principles

1. **Data Accuracy First**
   - All vendor data must be validated before publication
   - Multiple source verification required
   - Clear audit trail of changes
   - Regular data quality checks

2. **Automated Discovery**
   - AI-powered vendor detection
   - Multiple detection channels
   - Confidence scoring system
   - Duplicate detection and handling

3. **Human-in-the-Loop**
   - AI assists but doesn't replace human judgment
   - Clear validation workflows
   - Expert review requirements
   - Feedback loops for system improvement

4. **Version Control**
   - All changes are tracked
   - Historical data preservation
   - Change impact analysis
   - Rollback capabilities

## System Components

### 1. Vendor Detection System
- Monitors various data sources
- Identifies potential new vendors
- Calculates confidence scores
- Triggers validation workflows
- Manages duplicate detection

### 2. Data Collection Engine
- AI-powered data gathering
- Multiple source integration
- Data standardization
- Initial quality checks
- Source credibility scoring

### 3. Validation Workflow Engine
- Manages validation process
- Assigns reviewers
- Tracks progress
- Enforces validation rules
- Handles approvals

### 4. Publication System
- Controls data release
- Manages versioning
- Handles distribution
- Monitors impact
- Supports rollbacks

### 5. Change Management System
- Detects data changes
- Manages update workflow
- Tracks modifications
- Handles notifications
- Maintains audit trail

## Data Architecture

### Core Vendor Profile
```json
{
  "vendorId": "string",
  "basicInfo": {
    "legalName": "string",
    "tradingName": "string",
    "website": "string",
    "founded": "date",
    "headquarters": {
      "country": "string",
      "city": "string"
    }
  },
  "contacts": {
    "support": {
      "email": "string",
      "phone": "string",
      "url": "string"
    },
    "billing": {
      "email": "string",
      "phone": "string"
    }
  },
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "category": "string",
      "description": "string"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "createdAt": "datetime",
    "lastUpdated": "datetime",
    "lastValidated": "datetime",
    "status": "enum",
    "confidenceScore": "number"
  }
}
```

### Validation Records
```json
{
  "validationId": "string",
  "vendorId": "string",
  "type": "enum", // new, update, periodic
  "status": "enum",
  "validator": "string",
  "startedAt": "datetime",
  "completedAt": "datetime",
  "changes": [
    {
      "field": "string",
      "oldValue": "any",
      "newValue": "any",
      "source": "string",
      "confidence": "number"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Workflows

### New Vendor Detection
1. System detects potential new vendor
2. Initial data collection triggered
3. Duplicate check performed
4. Confidence score calculated
5. Validation workflow initiated

### Data Validation
1. Validator assigned
2. AI-collected data presented
3. Source verification performed
4. Missing data collected
5. Quality checks run
6. Approval process completed

### Data Publication
1. Final review conducted
2. Version created
3. Impact analyzed
4. Publication scheduled
5. Systems notified
6. Monitoring initiated

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Role-based access management
- Action-level permissions
- Audit logging
- Session management

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest
- Secure transmission
- Privacy controls
- Data retention policies

### Compliance
- Regulatory requirements
- Industry standards
- Documentation
- Audit support

## Integration Points

### Internal Systems
- User Interface
- Analytics Platform
- Reporting System
- Notification Service

### External Systems
- Data Providers
- Verification Services
- Industry Databases
- News Sources

## Best Practices

### Data Management
1. Regular data audits
