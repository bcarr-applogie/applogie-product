### Executive Visibility
- **Access Level**: Enterprise-wide view access

### Data Specialists
- May have unique cross-department access for data management
- Focus on data accuracy and integration
- Example: [Diana Dwyer](../user-personas/external/data-specialist.md) ensuring data quality across departments relate to various aspects of the syste### Common Scenarios

### New Employee Onboarding
1. Finance team or delegated administrator creates user account
2. Department and role assignments are configured
3. Appropriate licenses are assigned
4. Technical integration details are provided if needed

### Subscription Onboarding
1. Business owner initiates subscription documentation
2. System prompts for required information
3. Automated reminders for missing details
4. Finance team validates and approves
5. Technical integration setup if required

### Role Changesing their roles in subscription management, document handling, and financial oversight.

## Key Principles

1. **Departmental Hierarchy**: Users are organized primarily by departments, with clear ownership hierarchies for subscriptions within each department.
2. **Role-Based Access**: Users see only the subscriptions and data relevant to their role and department.
3. **Flexible Administration**: While Finance typically manages user creation and department assignment, these responsibilities can be delegated.
4. **Document Management**: Support for both direct uploads and email-based document submissions.

## User Type Overview

### Primary Categorization
Users in Applogie fall into two main categories:

1. **Applogie Platform Users**
   - Have direct login access to Applogie
   - Manage subscriptions, departments, or other users
   - Can be either enterprise-level or department-level
   - Example: [Francine Fitzgerald](../user-personas/external/finance-director.md) as an Enterprise Finance Manager

2. **License Users**
   - Employees who use software subscriptions
   - May not have direct Applogie access
   - Are managed through the platform
   - Example: Various team members using Microsoft 365 licenses

## User-Department Relationships

### Department Association
- Users can be associated with one or more departments
- Department association determines access scope
- Users inherit department-specific permissions and restrictions

### Cross-Department Considerations
- Some users may need access to multiple departments

## User-Subscription Relationships

### Subscription Ownership

  - Handle renewals and changes
  - Example: [Samuel Singh](../user-personas/external/subscription-owner.md) managing specific vendor relationships

### License Assignment
- Users can be assigned licenses from multiple subscriptions
- License assignments can cross department boundaries if needed
- Usage tracking follows individual assignments
