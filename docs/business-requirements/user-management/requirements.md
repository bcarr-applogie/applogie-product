### UM-3: User Account Management
**Priority**: Must Have
**Acceptance Criteria**:

### UM-5: Department Management
**Priority**: Must Have
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The system must support the creation and management of departments.

### UM-7: User Session Management
**Priority**: Must Have
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The system must have a secure user session management system.
