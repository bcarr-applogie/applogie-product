## Core Requirements

### UM-1: User Type Distinction
**Priority**: Must Have
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The system must support two distinct user types: "Applogie Team User" and "Customer User".
- Applogie Team Users must be able to access multiple customer instances, while Customer Users are restricted to their own company's instance.
- There must be a clear separation of data and permissions between the two user types.

- Applogie Team Users must be able to switch between customer instances seamlessly.
- The system must provide a mechanism to search and filter customer instances.
- Applogie Team Users must have the ability to view customer configurations and perform administrative actions as defined by their roles.

### UM-3: User Account Management
**Priority**: Must Have
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The system must support the creation, modification, and deactivation of user accounts.
- Each user account must have a unique identifier.
- All changes to user account status must be tracked in an audit log.

### UM-4: Role-Based Access Control
**Priority**: Must Have
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The system must support a role-based access control (RBAC) model.
- The system must include a "Super User" role for Applogie Team Users with unrestricted access to all data.
- The system must have a default set of roles for both Applogie Team Users and Customer Users.

### UM-5: Department Management
**Priority**: Must Have
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The system must support the creation and management of departments.
- Customer Users must be assignable to departments.
- Department assignments must be used to control access to resources.

### UM-6: Applogie Team User Access Control
**Priority**: Must Have
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Access to customer instances for Applogie Team Users must be configurable.
- By default, Applogie Team Users should not have access to any customer instances unless explicitly granted.

### UM-7: User Session Management
**Priority**: Must Have
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The system must have a secure user session management system.
- The system must automatically log out users after a configurable period of inactivity.

## User Interface Requirements

### UI-1: Customer Context Switcher
**Priority**: Must Have
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Applogie Team Users must have a persistent and easily accessible UI element to switch between customer contexts.
- The context switcher must clearly indicate the current customer context.
- The context switcher must provide a way to search for customer instances.

### UI-2: Distinguish Applogie Team Users
**Priority**: Must Have
**Business Value**: Provides transparency to customers about who is making changes to their data.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When a Customer User sees a user's name or avatar in the UI, there must be a clear visual indicator if that user is an Applogie Team User.
- This indicator should be present in all places where a user's identity is displayed, such as audit logs, user lists, and "last updated by" fields.
- The visual distinction should be easily understandable and not rely solely on color.

### UI-3: User Management Interface
**Priority**: Must Have
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The user management interface must allow administrators to search, filter, and sort the list of users.
- The interface must display the status, roles, and department associations for each user.
- The interface must support bulk operations for common user management tasks.

## Data Management Requirements

### DM-1: Tenant Data Isolation
**Priority**: Must Have
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The system must enforce strict data isolation between tenants (customers).
- There must be no data leakage between tenants.

### DM-2: User Profile Data
**Priority**: Must Have
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The system must store essential user profile information, including name, email, contact details, department associations, and role assignments.

## Future Considerations
- **UI-4: Role Management Interface**: A more advanced interface for managing roles and permissions.
- **UI-5: Department Management Interface**: A more advanced interface for managing departments and their relationships.
- **Bulk User Import**: The ability to import multiple users from a file.
